Abstract:

The Emergency QR Code Generator is a web-based application developed to enhance safety by quickly providing access to essential personal and vehicle information in emergency situations. The application generates a scannable QR code that stores vital data such as name, vehicle details, contact numbers, blood group, emergency contacts, and full address. This tool is designed to make critical information easily accessible to emergency responders, medical personnel, or law enforcement in the event of an accident, health crisis, or other urgent situations. The app also allows users to download the generated QR code in PNG format for offline storage or sharing.

Development Overview:

The project is developed using a combination of standard web technologies, including HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Here's a breakdown of the technologies used:

HTML: The structure of the webpage is built using HTML, where various input fields allow users to enter personal information like name, phone numbers, emergency contacts, etc.
CSS: The page is styled using custom CSS, ensuring it is visually appealing with a modern layout. A gradient background is used, along with responsive design elements to ensure compatibility across devices.
JavaScript: JavaScript handles the main functionality of the app. The logic includes validating inputs, generating the QR code with the help of an external API, and allowing the user to download the QR code as a PNG file. Event listeners are used to trigger actions when users click the "Generate QR Code" or "Download QR" buttons.
External APIs: The QR code generation is powered by an external API, api.qrserver.com, which creates QR codes based on the provided data. The app fetches the generated image from this API and displays it on the page.
How It Works:

User Input: The user fills out a form with personal information, vehicle details, and emergency contacts.

The form includes fields for the full name, vehicle number, vehicle type, mobile number, alternative number, emergency contact, blood group, and address.
Data Validation: Before generating the QR code, the app validates the data:

The vehicle number is checked for at least four letters and six numbers.
The phone numbers are validated to ensure they are 10 digits long.
QR Code Generation: After validation, the app sends the data to the QR code API to generate a scannable QR code. This QR code will contain all the entered information.

Download Option: Users can download the QR code as a PNG file by clicking the "Download QR" button. This allows users to store the QR code offline and have it accessible in case of an emergency.

Benefits & Use Cases:

Safety Enhancement: By storing emergency information in a QR code, users ensure that crucial details like medical conditions, emergency contacts, and vehicle info are readily available to first responders. This can help save time in critical situations.
Quick Access to Information: Emergency responders can scan the QR code with a smartphone to instantly retrieve the necessary information, improving response times and decision-making in high-pressure situations.
Offline Storage: The ability to download the QR code means that users can keep it in a physical form, such as on a printed card or saved on their device, making it easy to access even without an internet connection.
User-Friendly Interface: The web app is designed to be simple and intuitive, ensuring that anyone can use it, regardless of their technical knowledge.
